Hello, thanks for stopping by! :wave:

I am a dedicated researcher focusing on `applying machine learning techniques to process systems engineering`. My work spans various areas such as process modelling, soft sensing, process monitoring, state estimation, optimization, fault diagnosis, sensor placement, and control. Currently, I am a **postdoctoral fellow** in the [Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/engineering/chemical-materials-engineering/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/index.html) (Canada) under the supervision of [Prof. Biao Huang](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/bhuang). In addition, I am involved in industrial applications at [Syncrude (operated by Suncor)](https://www.suncor.com/en-ca/what-we-do/oil-sands/syncrude), where I lead and contribute to various practical projects.

I received my **PhD** from the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://www.che.iitb.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) (India) in August 2022, where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Mani Bhushan](https://www.che.iitb.ac.in/faculty/mani-bhushan). My doctoral research focused on *Sensor placement design using system-level measures for applications in fault detection, diagnosis, and variable estimation*.

For a complete list of my publications, please visit the [Publication page](/sa-prana/publications/).

A brief summary of my resume can be found on the [Resume page](/sa-prana/cv/).

In my free time, I enjoy running, engaging in a few sports activities, practising yoga, exploring nature on treks and hikes with friends, and capturing unique perspectives through [photography](/sa-prana/photography/).
